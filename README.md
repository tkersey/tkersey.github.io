# tkersey.github.io

A minimal, pragmatic static blog setup intended to be generated by a Zig tool and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Layout

- `site.yml`: site configuration (title, base URL, etc.)
- `posts/`: Markdown posts with YAML front matter (`--- ... ---`)
- `static/`: static assets copied into the output
- `dist/`: generated site output (ignored by git; CI deploys this)

## Local usage

```bash
# Generate the site into dist/
zig build

# Serve dist/ locally (currently: rebuild once, no watch yet)
zig build serve
```

## Work tracking

This repo uses `bd` (beads). See `AGENTS.md` and `.beads/BD_GUIDE.md`.
